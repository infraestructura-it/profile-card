## Customization

Edit this data in src/pages/index.astro

- **`name`**: Enter your name here.
- **`position`**: Enter your job position here.
- **`about me`**: Write a brief description of who you are and what you do. It's recommended to keep it under 540 characters.

- **`profileImage`**: Upload your professional profile picture here.

To use more social links, copy and paste this block of code in /src/components/Card.astro file in the position of your desire inside the card.

```sh
<a href={twitterx} class="hover-text" target="_blank">
    <span class="tooltip-text" id="fade">
        Twitter/X
    </span>
    <i class="bi bi-twitter-x"></i>
</a>
````
Change the icon by modifying **`bi-new-icon`** to an icon from the [Bootstrap Website](https://icons.getbootstrap.com).

Then rename the variable newSocialLink in **`<a href={newSocialLink} class="hover-text" target="_blank">`**, and add the new variable in **`const {name, position, aboutMe, linkedin, github, telegram, twitterx, newSocialLink, cvLink } = Astro.props;`**.

Add the new variable in /src/pages/index.astro below the existing social links.

```sh
<Card	name="Carlos Jurado"
    position="Bioengineering | Brain modulation | Artificial Intelligence"
    aboutMe="Dedicated Bioengineer with expertise in medical devices and neuromodulation, pursuing a Master’s in AI.
